# BBP Auto Block for bbPress

## Version 0.1.1

When a topic or reply is marked as spam, create or increment a user meta field for the author.

When a user exceeds the allowable spam items, set the user's forum role to 'blocked'.

See Settings > Forum Settings > Spam Limit to set the number of allowable spam items.<br>
Defaults to 0 - which means that a user's role will be changed to 'blocked' the first time their Topic or Reply is marked as spam.


Tested on multisite: Set spam limits and user spam count per blog
